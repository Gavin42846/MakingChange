# MakingChange
This was the first game I ever made, it was made in Unity and was for a GameJam with the theme "Change". 

Was made in a Game Design class when I was working towards getting my Bach Degree in Software Engineering. 
Had 1 week to design and create the game with 0 experience in Unity or any other game engines.
